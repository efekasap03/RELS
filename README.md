### CS320 Real Estate Listing System

**Notes for developers:**

Write your code inside src/main/java/rels/\[package-name-you-want\] , consult with AI or groupchat for project folder structure


RELS is designed to streamline property management operations by connecting with a relational database to manage property listings, clients, admin accounts, and landlord profiles. The system supports three user roles: Admin, Landlord, and Client. Landlords add properties for clients to view and bid on, then review bids and selects tenants. Admins oversee the entire system, manage users and add landlords. Once the landlord selects a client, they handle all further arrangements independently.
